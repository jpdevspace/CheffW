# Cheff Watson

Finally an app that you can really use while cooking, say bye to messing up your phone with food while you try to scroll down to follow the recipe. When prompted by the app, please allow the use of your built-in microphone for a better experience

## Comments
This app was created using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) and the built-in Web Speech API available in Chrome browsers to listen for user's command.

## Instructions
Users can search for recipes using 4 different key ingredients: chicken, pasta, beef or fish. Using either the keyboard or their voice. From then, select a recipe that they like to cook and get the list of ingredients and detailed instructions to cook that meal. All of this is done in a Single Application fashion for better user experience. If the user sees something that they like, they can register and save any recipe to revisit later from their dashboard, as well as update the status on a recipe or remove it entirely from their profile.
